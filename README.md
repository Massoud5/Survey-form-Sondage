What I learned:

- Background new attributs like "position:fixed" and some details that took a lot
of time.

- Name, email and number requering and avaibility error by "HTML Markup".

- Some details in "radio" and "checkbox" input.

- I encountered a new problem: "Collapsing margins" 
  and I solve it with "inline-block".
